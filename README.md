# Calories-Burned-Prediction

This project aims to predict the number of calories burned during physical activities based on user-provided data such as age, gender, height, weight, duration, and type of activity. Using machine learning techniques, the model learns patterns in physical activity data to provide accurate calorie burn estimations.

## Project Overview
In health and fitness applications, accurately estimating calories burned is crucial for tracking activity levels and managing weight. This project utilizes machine learning to predict calorie expenditure by analyzing key physiological and activity-related parameters. The model helps users estimate their energy expenditure for various exercises, enhancing their ability to make informed health decisions.

## Features
Data Collection: Collects data such as age, weight, height, gender, type of activity, and duration.

Machine Learning Model: Trains a regression model to predict calories burned based on provided inputs.

Interactive Interface: Offers a simple interface to input data and retrieve predictions (optional).

Visualization: Provides visualizations to help understand relationships between variables and predictions.

## Installation
1. Clone Repository:

   git clone https://github.com/hhdjwdabsxsx/Calories-Burned-Prediction.git
cd calories-burned-prediction

2. Install Dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Prepare the dataset

   Ensure you have a dataset of activities and calories burned. Use this sample dataset or upload your own in the data/ directory.

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
   
   python main.py

   This will load the trained model, prompt for user input, and display the estimated calories burned.

3. Model Training (if needed):

   python train.py

    This will take in your dataset, train the model, and save it for future predictions.

## Model Trainning

The model is trained using a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to estimate calorie burn. You can modify the training parameters in config.py for better accuracy.

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset for consistency.

2. Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features like activity type, duration, etc.

3. Model Training: Trains the model using the processed data.

4. Evaluation: Evaluates the model's accuracy with test data.

## Future Improvements

Enhanced Model: Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., neural networks) for higher accuracy.

Additional Features: Include environmental factors like temperature or terrain for more precise predictions.

Mobile Integration: Create an app for easier access.
